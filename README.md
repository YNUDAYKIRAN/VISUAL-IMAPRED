📌 Project Title
Smart Blind Stick for Visually Impaired Navigation

📝 Project Description
The Smart Blind Stick is an assistive technology project designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings safely and independently. Using a combination of sensors and embedded systems, this stick detects obstacles in the user's path and provides real-time alerts through vibration or audio signals.

The system is built using ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement, a microcontroller (like Arduino) for processing, and optional features like a buzzer, GPS module, or RFID tags for enhanced navigation. It aims to improve mobility, prevent collisions, and enhance situational awareness for users with visual challenges.
